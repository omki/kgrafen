        "description": "Another symposium on 2D materials took place in Copenhagen. The Carbonhagen series of meetings began in 2010 when it was one of two symposia on graphene and other two-dimensional materials in Europe. This year, during its ninth and last edition, it is accompanied by about 50 similar meetings throughout Europe.<br><br>Our representative at the Carbohagen 2019 conference, a member of the Polish Scientific Committee of SEP for Graphene Technology, Michał Radwański participated in this event together with over 125 representatives of graphene research. The most numerous were scientists from Denmark and the UK, there were also researchers from China and the USA. During two days filled with news about the work on 2D materials, you could hear about the latest developments in the field of synthesis and processing of high quality graphene, production of devices using heterostructures and methods of graphene metrology. Many speakers presented their work or mentioned progress in twistronics, i.e. the study of the properties of two-layer graphene where the layers are twisted relative to each other showing completely new properties depending on the angle of displacement and announced that this was the beginning of a whole new chapter of research on graphene and the next order, other 2D materials. Interesting for the Polish Scientific Committee of SEP for Graphene Technology in the context of work on nanocomposites with graphene fillers was the speech of Maria Iliut from the University of Manchester, co-founder of the gra ~ fine company, in which she presented the spectacular success of their footwear, where rubber is produced from graphene composite , far exceeding the durability, flexibility and abrasion resistance of commercially available sports footwear.<br><br>The meeting resulted in establishing behind-the-scenes relationships and enabled us to present our Committee at an international level. It opened new opportunities for cooperation and exchange of experiences with world leaders in the work on graphene."
